\begin{abstract}
    We present a new protocol and system for using web proxies. The proxies are supported using Bitcoin microtransactions, where a client pays a fee for requests completed by the proxy. Using the micropayment structure protects both the client and the server, allowing either to only suffer a loss of one microtransaction. The structure has many benefits, including protecting clients from being tracked, improved incentives for proxy servers to be fast and available, and resistance to censorship.
