\begin{abstract}
We design and implement a SOCKS based proxy system supported through Bitcoin micropayments. Our system easily allows proxy networks to be built and used due to our simple paid incentive structure and multiple discovery systems. Bitcoin micropayments enable a system where clients and proxies can mutually distrust the other's payment and service, allowing either side to disconnect at any time without monetary loss. The large pool of available proxies which the system will attract provides clients with the ability to rotate amongst a large number of proxies while browsing the web which makes it very difficult to trace a client. The structure has many benefits, including protecting clients from being tracked, improved incentives for proxy servers to be fast and available, and resistance to censorship.
