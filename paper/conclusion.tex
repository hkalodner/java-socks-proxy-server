\subsection{Clients as Servers}

In our system, there is no reason why a client can't also behave as a server. Thus, if a client wanted to use the system, but was intimidated by the prospect of paying, they could instead view the system as one where people trade off taking turns as server and client, exchanging requests. The Bitcoin payments implement a balance between clients and servers. Those who do not wish to play the role of the server often enough are required to compensate by contributing Bitcoins, and those who play the role of the server often are rewarded with Bitcoin compensation. In the situation where all users are acting as both a client and a server, the only loss of Bitcoins would be those that are lost to transactions fees, a quantity which is quite small.
