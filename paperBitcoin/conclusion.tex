\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We designed and implemented proxy rotation system by Bitcoin micropayments. Although our prototype the payment structure was simplified and periodic changing of the proxy pool was not implemented, we created enough of the system to demonstrate our idea's speed and versatility. We were able to test with multiple clients and servers in a local WiFi network to verify that our system was successful. This demonstrates the basic feasibility of integrating micropayments into proxy connections.
